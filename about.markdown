This is the blog and personal website of Corentin Godeau.

I work at [Streamroot](https://streamroot.io/), a former startup acquired by [Lumen Technologies](https://www.lumen.com/en-us/home.html).

I'm really into understanding how things work to the deepest level, as I personally believe this is the only way for a software engineer to be able to produce high quality software. I think that reinventing the wheel is sometimes a necessity and I value craftsmanship.
